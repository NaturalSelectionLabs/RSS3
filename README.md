# RSS3 Protocol

The RSS3 Protocol follows the RSS3 Whitepaper and aims to build a decentralized, open source, and extensible protocol for the dissenmination of Open Information.

## Motivation

Open Information, indexed from multiple permissionless data sources (PDSs), is structured according to the structure outlined in this Protocol. Therefore, the Protocol acts as the specific data structure facilitating the dissenmination of Open Information on the RSS3 Network.

Given that PDSs employ diverse data structures, within any given PDS, it's common to find products, services, and protocols, each utilizing distinct data structures to meet their unique requirements. This lack of standardization means limited interoperability, posing a challenge to the development of scalable applications using Open Information.

## Objective

The Protocol aims to tackle this issue by offering a comprehensive set of data structures that serve as an abstraction. The abstraction simplifies data integration processes, thus making it more manageable and scalable for developers to work with Open Information. This, in turn, promotes the free flow of Open Information.
